                        <li>Find a nearby bike on the map and reserve it for up to 15 minutes free of charge. Make your choice between a mechanical (marked in orange) or an electric (marked in green) bike.</li>

                        <li>Scan the QR code to unlock your vehicle, or alternatively type in the 4-digit ID code, visible on the right and left sides of each bike’s frame.</li>

                        For manual bikes, please lock manually using the smart lock above the rear tire, then end your rental from the app by pressing the “Lock”, then “End rental session” buttons on the app.
                        <br><br>
                        E-bikes can lock automatically, so no manual locking is required when ending your session or pausing through the app!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        *Use the “Pause” function after locking for quick stops along your ride. You can pause anywhere, including outside the pick-up and drop off zone, if needed. For safety reasons, mechanical bikes require manual locking to enter “Pause” mode.
                    </p>

                        Our current pricing model is composed of three elements.
                        <br><br>
                        For mechanical bikes it is 1.5 BGN unlock fee and 0.15 BGN per minute thereafter. The 24-hour rate is 24 BGN and it applies automatically once that amount is reached.
                        <br><br>
                        For electric bikes the pricing is composed of 1.9 BGN unlock fee and 0.29 BGN per minute thereafter. The 24-hour rate is 48 BGN and again it is applied automatically.
                        <br><br>

                        Yes, the highest fee you can pay for 24 hours is 24 BGN for a mechanical bike, and 48 BGN for an e-bike.
                        <br><br>
                        Please keep in mind that the full-day rental fee is valid only if you use the same bike for the entire period without ending your session. If you end your rental session and start a new one, regardless of whether you rent the same bike or a new one, the countdown to 24 / 48 BGN will start again.

                    <p>
                        This charge corresponds to a previous ride where the payment could not go though (due to insufficient funds, failed or declined payment, or other reasons). It means we have tried to recover an outstanding payment for one of your past rides.
                        <br><br>
                        Check your ride history in the app to match the amount and identify the ride that the charge is for, or contact us for further assistance at <a href="tel:+359896755556" class="underline-text">+359 896 755 556</a> or <a href="mailto:info@cyrcl.eu" class="underline-text">info@cyrcl.eu</a> (support team working hours: 8:00 — 24:00)

                    <p>
                        When you start a ride with us, our app holds a temporary pre-ride deposit. You’ll notice this as a pending charge on your payment method. The amount we hold temporarily is 5 BGN; after your ride is completed, Cyrcl automatically removes the hold, and charges you only for the ride’s cost.
                        <br><br>
                        Sometimes it may take a few days for your bank or payment provider to release the hold from their end. If after 7 days, the pre-ride hold still appears on your account, we recommend reaching out to your bank for more information.

                    <p>
                        We prioritise the security and privacy of our users. Therefore, we may find it necessary to suspend accounts for various reasons:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Erratic behavior:</strong> An account might be suspended if it involves unusual user behaviour that raises concerns about the account’s security. This could include indications that the account has been compromised, is using fraudulent information, or is being shared among multiple users.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Unsafe riding:</strong> Riding in pedestrian only areas, intentionally damaging our vehicles, or riding while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, can result in the suspension of your account. It’s essential to adhere to our T&C, outlined in the User’s Agreement, to guarantee a safe and enjoyable experience for all involved.
                        <br><br>
                        If you’re confident that none of these apply to your situation, please reach out to our customer support team for further assistance.

                        Full-day rental is activated automatically once the daily rental fee is reached. The highest fee you can pay for 24 hours is 24 BGN for a mechanical bike, and 48 BGN for an e-bike. Yes, you got it right! We won’t charge you for any additional minutes until the 24-hour rental limit is reached!

                        Please, keep in mind that the full-day rental fee is valid only if you use the same bike for the entire period without ending your session. If you end your rental session and start a new one, regardless of whether you rent the same bike or another, you will be charged for the new session you begin according to our current pricing list. For your convenience, you can use the “Pause” option for breaks between rides, without breaking your 24-hour streak!

                        Pausing your ride is easy! If you are riding a mechanical bike, push the smart lock lever down manually (located on top of the bike’s rear tyre), then press the “Lock” and “Pause” buttons successively. E-bikes lock automatically once you follow the same steps through the app.
